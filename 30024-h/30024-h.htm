<h2>THE FISHER-BOY URASHIMA.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px; margin-top: -2em;">
<img src="images/img_l.jpg" width="75" height="100" alt="L" title="" />
</div>
<p>ong, long ago there lived
on the coast of the sea
of Japan a young fisherman
named Urashima, a kindly lad
and clever with his rod and line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img004.jpg" width="375" height="592" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>Well, one day he went out in
his boat to fish. But instead of
catching any fish, what do you
think he caught? Why! a great
big tortoise, with a hard shell
and such a funny wrinkled old
face and a tiny tail. Now I
must tell you something which
very likely you don&#8217;t know; and
that is that tortoises always live
a thousand years,&mdash;at least Japanese
tortoises do. So Urashima
thought to himself: &ldquo;A fish would
do for my dinner just as well as
this tortoise,&mdash;in fact better. Why
should I go and kill the poor
thing, and prevent it from enjoying
itself for another nine hundred
and ninety-nine years? No, no!
I won&#8217;t be so cruel. I am sure
mother wouldn&#8217;t like me to.&rdquo;
And with these words, he threw
the tortoise back into the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img007.jpg" width="375" height="505" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>The next thing that happened
was that Urashima went to sleep
in his boat; for it was one of
those hot summer days when
almost everybody enjoys a nap
of an afternoon. And as he slept,
there came up from beneath the
waves a beautiful girl,
who got into the boat and said:
&ldquo;I am the daughter of the Sea-God,
and I live with my father
in the Dragon Palace beyond
the waves. It was not a tortoise
that you caught just now,
and so kindly threw back into the
water instead of killing it. It was
myself. My father the Sea-God
had sent me to see whether you
were good or bad.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 558px;">
<img src="images/img009.jpg" width="558" height="255" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;We now know that you are a
good, kind boy who doesn&#8217;t like
to do cruel things; and so I have
come to fetch you. You shall
marry me, if you like; and we
will live happily together for a
thousand years in the Dragon
Palace beyond the deep blue sea.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 598px;">
<img src="images/img011.jpg" width="598" height="208" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>So Urashima took one oar, and
the Sea-God&#8217;s daughter took the
other; and they rowed, and they
rowed, and they rowed till at last
they came to the Dragon Palace
where the Sea-God lived and ruled
as King over all the dragons
and the tortoises and the fishes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 598px;">
<img src="images/img013.jpg" width="598" height="361" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>Oh dear! what a lovely place
it was! The walls of the Palace
were of coral, the trees had
emeralds for leaves and rubies
for berries, the fishes&#8217; scales were
of silver, and the dragons&#8217; tails
of solid gold. Just think of the
very most beautiful, glittering
things that you have ever seen,
and put them all together,
and then you will know what
this Palace looked like. And
it all belonged to Urashima;
for was he not the son-in-law of
the Sea-God, the husband of the
lovely Dragon Princess?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img014.jpg" width="375" height="601" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img015.jpg" width="375" height="477" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>Well, they lived on happily
for three years, wandering about
every day among the beautiful
trees with emerald leaves and
ruby berries. But one morning
Urashima said to his wife: &ldquo;I
am very happy here. Still I
want to go home and see my
father and mother and brothers
and sisters. Just let me go for
a short time, and I&#8217;ll soon be
back again.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&#8217;t like you
to go,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I am very
much afraid that something dreadful
will happen. However, if you
will go, there is no help for it.
Only you must take this box, and
be very careful not to open it.
If you open it, you will never
be able to come back here.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img017.jpg" width="375" height="378" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>So Urashima promised to take
great care of the box, and not
to open it on any account; and
then, getting into his boat, he
rowed off, and at last landed on
the shore of his own country.</p>

<p>But what had happened while
he had been away? Where had
his father&#8217;s cottage gone to?
What had become of the village
where he used to live? The
mountains indeed were there as
before; but the trees on them
had been cut down. The little
brook that ran close by his
father&#8217;s cottage was still running;
but there were no women washing
clothes in it any more. It
seemed very strange that everything
should have changed so
much in three short years. So
as two men chanced to pass
along the beach, Urashima went
up to them and said: &ldquo;Can you
tell me please where Urashima&#8217;s
cottage, that used to stand here,
has been moved to?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Urashima?&rdquo;
said they; &ldquo;why! it was
four hundred years ago that he
was drowned out fishing. His
parents, and his brothers, and
their grandchildren are all dead
long ago. It is an old, old story.
How can you be so foolish as to
ask after his cottage? It fell to
pieces hundreds of years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 598px;">
<img src="images/img021.jpg" width="598" height="336" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>Then it suddenly flashed
across Urashima&#8217;s mind that the
Sea-God&#8217;s Palace beyond the
waves, with its coral walls and
its ruby fruits and its dragons
with tails of solid gold, must be
part of fairy-land, and that one
day there was probably as long
as a year in this world, so that
his three years in the Sea-God&#8217;s
Palace had really been hundreds
of years. Of course there was
no use in staying at home, now
that all his friends were dead
and buried, and even the village
had passed away. So Urashima
was in a great hurry to get back
to his wife, the Dragon Princess
beyond the sea. But which was
the way? He couldn&#8217;t find it
with no one to show it to him.
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;if I
open the box which she gave me,
I shall be able to find the way.&rdquo;
So he disobeyed her orders not
to open the box,&mdash;or perhaps
he forgot them, foolish boy that
he was. Anyhow he opened
the box; and what do you
think came out of it?
Nothing but a white cloud which
floated away over the sea. Urashima
shouted to the cloud to
stop, rushed about and screamed
with sorrow; for he remembered
now what his wife had told him,
and how, after opening the box,
he should never be able to go
to the Sea-God&#8217;s Palace again.
But soon he could neither run
nor shout any more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 598px;">
<img src="images/img025.jpg" width="598" height="464" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>Suddenly his hair grew as white
as snow, his face got wrinkled,
and his back bent like that of a
very old man. Then his breath
stopped short, and he fell down
dead on the beach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/img027.jpg" width="375" height="287" alt="image" title="" />
</div>

<p>Poor Urashima! He died because
he had been foolish and
disobedient. If only he had done
as he was told, he might have
lived another thousand years.
Wouldn&#8217;t you like to go and
see the Dragon Palace beyond
the waves, where the Sea-God
lives and rules as King over the
Dragons and the tortoises and
the fishes, where the trees have
emeralds for leaves and rubies
for berries, where the fishes&#8217; tails
are of silver and the dragons&#8217;
tails all of solid gold?</p>
